- Emulation of ISO 9660 program mkisofs by program

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>xorrisofs</b>
[ options ] [-o filename ] pathspec [pathspecs ...]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>xorrisofs</b>
produces Rock Ridge enhanced ISO 9660 filesystems and
add-on sessions to such filesystems. Optionally it can
produce Joliet directory trees too.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>xorrisofs</b>
understands options of program mkisofs from cdrtools by
Joerg Schilling. Its implementation is part of program
xorriso which shares no source code with cdrtools.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&nbsp;<BR><b>ISO 9660, Rock Ridge, Joliet, HFS+:</b><BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>ISO 9660</b> (aka <b>ECMA-119</b>) is a
read-only filesystem that is mainly used for optical
media CD, DVD, BD, but may also reside on other storage
devices like disk files, USB sticks or disk partitions. It
is widely readable by many operating systems and by boot
facilities of personal computers. <br>
ISO 9660 describes directories and data files by very
restricted filenames with no distinction of upper case and
lower case. Its metadata do not comply to fundamental POSIX
specifications. <b><br> Rock Ridge</b> is the name of a set of additional
information which enhance an ISO 9660 filesystem so that it
can represent a POSIX compliant filesystem with ownership,
access permissions, symbolic links, and other attributes.
Rock Ridge allows filenames of up to 255 bytes and paths of
up to 1024 bytes. <br>
xorrisofs produces Rock Ridge information by default. It is
strongly discouraged to disable this feature. <b><br> Joliet</b> is the name of an additional directory tree which
provides filenames up to 64 characters encoded as
UTF-16. A Joliet tree is mainly interesting for
reading the ISO image by operating systems of Microsoft
Corporation. Production of this directory tree may be
enabled by option -J. <b><br> ISO 9660:1999</b> is the name of an additional directory
tree which provides longer filenames. It allows single file
names to have up to 207 characters. It might be of use with
some older computer system boot facilities which read
neither Rock Ridge nor Joliet but need longer filenames
nevertheless. Production of this directory tree may be
enabled by option -iso-level 4. <b><br> HFS+</b> is the name of a filesystem which is normally used
for writing and reading on hard disks and similar devices.
It is possible to embed a HFS+ partition into the emerging
ISO 9660 image and to mark it by Apple Partition Map
entries. This interferes with options which copy data into
the first 32 KiB of the ISO image, like -G or
-isohybrid-mbr. See option -hfsplus. <br>
The main purpose for having an embedded HFS+ partition is
booting of certain models of Apple computers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&nbsp;<BR><b>Inserting files into the ISO image:</b><BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>xorrisofs</b> deals with two kinds of file addresses:
<b><br> disk_path</b> is a path to an object in the local filesystem
tree. <b><br> iso_rr_path</b> is the Rock Ridge address of a file object
in the ISO image. If no Rock Ridge information shall be
stored in an emerging ISO, then the names will get mapped to
ISO 9660 names of limited length and character set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A program
argument is handled as a <b>pathspec</b>, if it is not
recognized as original mkisofs option or additional
<b>xorrisofs</b> option. A pathspec depicts an input file
object by a disk_path. If option -graft-points
is not present, then the behavior depends on the file type
of disk_path. Directories get merged with the
/-directory of the ISO image. Files of other types get
copied into the /-directory. <br>
If -graft-points is present then each pathspec
gets split at the first occurrence of the =-character.
The part before the = is taken as <b>target</b>, i.e. the
iso_rr_path for the file object in the ISO image. The part
after the first = is taken as <b>source</b>, i.e. the
disk_path of the input object. <br>
It is possible to make =-characters part of the
iso_rr_path by preceding them with a \-character. The
same must be done for \-characters which shall be part
of the iso_rr_path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the source
part of the pathspec leads to a directory, then all files
underneath this directory get inserted into the image, too.
It is possible to exclude particular files from being
inserted by help of option -m. <br>
In case that target already exists, the following rules
apply: Directories and other files may overwrite existing
non-directories. Directories get merged with existing
directories. Non-directories may not overwrite
existing directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&nbsp;<BR><b>Relation to program xorriso:</b><BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>xorrisofs</b> is actually a command mode of program
<b>xorriso</b>, which gets entered either by xorriso command
&quot;-as mkisofs&quot; or by starting the program by
one of the names &quot;xorrisofs&quot;, &quot;mkisofs&quot;,
&quot;genisoimage&quot;, or &quot;genisofs&quot;. <br>
This command mode can be left by argument
&quot;--&quot; which leads to generic xorriso
command mode. See <b>man xorriso</b> for its
description.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">xorriso
performs image reading and writing by help of libburn, which
is mainly intended for optical drives, but also operates on
all POSIX file types except directories. <br>
The program messages call any image file a
&quot;drive&quot;. File types which are not supported for
reading are reported as &quot;blank&quot;. The reported free
media space may be quite fictional. <br>
Nevertheless <b>xorrisofs</b> does not operate directly on
optical drives, but rather forces libburn to regard them as
general device files. So for writing of sequential optical
media (CD, DVD-R, DVD+R, BD-R) one will have to
use a burn program. E.g the cdrecord emulation of xorriso.
See EXAMPLES.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Image loading:</b><BR></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options control loading of an existing ISO image for the
purpose of preparing a suitable add-on session. If
they are missing then a new image is composed from scratch.
<b><br> -M</b> disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the path from which to load
the existing ISO image directory tree on which to base the
upcomming directory tree as add-on session. The path
must lead to a random-access readable file object. On
GNU/Linux: regular data files or block device files. <br>
A special kind of pseudo disk_path has the form
&quot;/dev/fd/&quot;number. It depicts the open file
descriptor with the given number, regardless whether the
operating system supports this feature by file nodes in
/dev/fd or not. E.g. /dev/fd/3 is file descriptor 3 which
was opened by the program that later started xorriso.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-prev-session</b>
disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alias of -M.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-dev</b> disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alias of -M.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-C</b>
last_session_start,next_writeable_address</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the 2 KiB block address
last_session_start from where to read the ISO image out of
the file given by option -M. <br>
Separated by a comma, set the next_writeable_address to
which the add-on session will finally be written.
Decisive is actually the block address which the intended
readers will have to use as superblock address on the
intended medium. <br>
Both values can be inquired from optical media by help of
burn programs and cdrecord option -msinfo. xorriso
itself can obtain it in its cdrecord emulation. Do not let
it load the drive, but rather do this manually or by a
program like dd which reads a few bytes. Only then it is
sure that the device driver knows the true readable size of
the medium. <br>
dd if=/dev/... count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <br>
values=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/...
-msinfo) <br>
echo $values <br>
Option -C may be used without option -M to
create an ISO image from scratch and prepare it for being
finally written to a block address other than 0. Parameter
last_session_start must then be set to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-cdrecord-params</b>
last_session_start,next_writeable_address</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alias of -C.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&nbsp;<BR><b>Settings for file insertion:</b><BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>-path-list</b> disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read pathspecs
line-by-line from disk_file and insert the
depicted file objects into the ISO image. If disk_path is
&quot;-&quot; then read the pathspecs from standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--quoted_path_list</b>
disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Like option
-path-list but reading quoted words rather than
plain lines. Whitespace outside of quotes will be discarded.
On the other hand it is possible to represent pathspecs
which contain newline characters. <br>
The double quotation mark &quot; and the single quotation
mark &rsquo; can be used to enclose whitespace and make it
part of pathspecs. Each mark type can enclose the marks of
the other type. A trailing backslash \ outside quotations or
an open quotation cause the next input line to be
appended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-follow-links</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alias of -f.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-graft-points</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable interpretation of input
file pathspecs as combination of iso_rr_path and disk_path,
separated by a =-character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-m</b>
disk_pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Exclude files from being
inserted into the image. Silently ignored are those files of
which the disk_path matches the given shell parser pattern.
If no /-character is part of the pattern, then it gets
matched against the leaf name of the disk file. <br>
It is possible to give more than one -m option.</p>

</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-transparent-compression</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alias of -z.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-root</b>
iso_rr_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Insert all files under the
given iso_rr_path. If option -graft-points is
given, then iso_rr_path is prepended to each target part of
a pathspec. <br>
The default for -root is &quot;/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-old-root</b>
iso_rr_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable incremental insertion of
files into the loaded image. The effective target and source
addresses of given pathspecs get compared whether the target
already exists in the ISO image and is still identical to
the source on disk. Metadata in the ISO image will get
adjusted, if they differ from those on disk. New files and
files with changed content will get newly added. Target
files which do not exist in any of the according pathspec
sources will get removed from the ISO directory tree. <br>
If the effective setting of -root differs from the
iso_rr_path given with -old-root, then the files
underneath the -old-root directory get cloned
underneath the -root directory. Cloning happens before
file comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--old-root-no-ino</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable recording and use of
disk inode numbers. If no disk inode numbers are recorded,
then option -old-root will have to read disk
file content and compare it with the MD5 checksum that is
recorded in the ISO image. <br>
With recorded disk inode numbers and with credible ctime and
mtime, it is possible to detect potential changes in the
content without actually reading it. A loophole remains if
multiple different filesystems may get mounted at the same
directory, like it is habit with /mnt. In this case one has
to use option --old-root-devno or
disable the inode number shortcut by
--old-root-no-ino.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--old-root-devno</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable comparison of recorded
device numbers together with recorded inode numbers. This
works only with good old stable device numbers which get out
of fashion, regrettably. If the hard disk has a different
device number after each reboot, then this comparison will
see all files as changed and thus prevent any incremental
size saving.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--old-root-no-md5</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable recording and use of
MD5 checksums for data file content. If neither checksums
and nor disk inode numbers are recorded, then option
-old-root will have to read ISO image file
content when comparing it with disk file content.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&nbsp;<BR><b>Settings for image production:</b><BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>-o</b> disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the output file address for
the emerging ISO image. If the address exists as regular
file, it will be truncated to length 0 when image production
begins. It may not already exist as directory. If it does
not exist yet then its parent directory must exist and a
regular file will get created. <br>
A special kind of pseudo disk_path has the form
&quot;/dev/fd/&quot;number. It depicts the open file
descriptor with the given number, regardless whether the
operating system supports this feature by file nodes in
/dev/fd or not. E.g. /dev/fd/4 is file descriptor 4 which
was opened by the program that later started xorriso. <br>
Default is standard output (/dev/fd/1) which may also be set
by disk_path &quot;-&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-output</b>
disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alias of -o.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--stdio_sync</b>
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|&quot;end&quot;|number</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the number of bytes after
which to force output to disk in order to keep the memory
from being clogged with lots of pending data for slow
devices. &quot;on&quot; is the same as &quot;16m&quot;.
Forced output can be disabled by &quot;off&quot;, or be
delayed by &quot;end&quot; until all data are produced. If a
number is chosen, then it must be at least 64k. <br>
The default with xorriso mkisofs emulation is
--stdio_sync &quot;off&quot;. <br>
xorriso uses an inner fifo buffer with default size 4 MiB.
So forcing the operating system i/o cache to disk does not
necessarily block the simultaneous production of more image
content.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--emul-toc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Write a second superblock with
the first session into random-access files. If further
sessions get appended and the first superblock gets updated,
then the second superblock will not be overwritten. So it is
still possible to mount the first session and to find the
start blocks of the further sessions. <br>
The price is 64 KiB extra space consumption. If
-partition_offset is non-zero, then it is 128
KiB plus twice the partition setup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-emul-toc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not write a second
superblock with the first session into random-access
files. <br>
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--sort-weight</b>
weight_number iso_rr_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Attribute a LBA weight number
to regular files. If iso_rr_path leads to a directory then
all regular files underneath will get the weight_number.
<br>
The weight_number may range from -2147483648 to
2147483647. The higher it is, the lower will be the block
address of the file data in the emerging ISO image.
Currently the El Torito boot catalog has a hardcoded weight
of 1 billion. Normally it should occupy the block with the
lowest possible address. Data files get added or loaded with
initial weight 0. Boot image files have a default weight of
2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--sort-weight-list</b>
disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read pairs of weight number and
iso_rr_path from a file of the local filesystem. Apply each
pair like with --sort-weight. <br>
Only the last --sort-weight-list or
--sort-weight-patterns of a
xorrisofs run gets into effect. <br>
The weight number is read from the start of the line. The
iso_rr_path part of an input line begins immediately after
the first blank or tab character of the line. <br>
Notes for the case that this feature is used within a
sequence of generic xorriso commands (not an issue with a
pure mkisofs emulation run): <br>
The addressed files must already be in the ISO image model
when you execute <br>
-as mkisofs --sort-weight-list
disk_path -- <br>
Several such commands may be used to apply more than one
weight file. <br>
Data files which are loaded by -indev or -dev
get a weight between 1 and 2 exp 28 = 268,435,456, depending
on their block address. This shall keep them roughly in the
same order if the write method of modifying is applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--sort-weight-patterns</b>
disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Like
--sort-weight-list , but expanding
the iso_rr_paths as shell parser patterns and applying
--sort-weight to each matching file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-dir-mode</b> mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the access permissions for
all directories in the image to the given mode which is
either an octal number beginning with &quot;0&quot; or a
comma separated list of statements of the form
[ugoa]*[+-=][rwxst]* . E.g. ug=rx,a-rwx</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-file-mode</b>
mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Like -dir-mode but
for all regular data files in the image.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>-pad</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Add 300 KiB to the end of the produced ISO image. This
circumvents possible read errors from ISO images which have
been written to CD media in TAO mode. The additional bytes
are claimed as part of the ISO image if not
--emul-toc is given.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Option -pad is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-no-pad</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable padding of 300 KiB to
the end of the produced ISO image. This is safe if the image
is not meant to be written on CD or if it gets written to CD
as only track in write mode SAO.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--old-empty</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use the old way of of giving
block addresses in the range of [0,31] to files with no own
data content. The new way is to have a dedicated block to
which all such files will point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&nbsp;<BR><b>Settings for standards compliance:</b><BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>-iso-level</b> number</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the ISO 9660 version
which defines the limitations of file naming and data file
size. The naming restrictions do not apply to the Rock Ridge
names but only to the low-level ISO 9660 names. There
are three conformance levels: <br>
Level 1 allows ISO names of the form 8.3 and file size up to
4 GiB - 1. <br>
Level 2 allows ISO names with up to 32 characters and file
size up to 4 GiB - 1. <br>
Level 3 allows ISO names with up to 32 characters and file
size of up to 400 GiB - 200 KiB. (This size limitation
is set by the xorriso implementation and not by ISO 9660
which would allow nearly 8 TiB.) <br>
Pseudo-level 4 enables production of an additional ISO
9660:1999 directory tree.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-disallow_dir_id_ext</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not follow a bad habit of
mkisofs which allows dots in the ISO names of directories.
On the other hand, some bootable GNU/Linux images depend on
this bad habit.</p>

mark it by Apple Partition Map (APM) entries in the System
Area, the first 32 KiB of the image. <br>
This may collide with options like -G or

the System Area get overwritten by { 0x45, 0x52, 0x08 0x00,
0xeb, 0x02, 0xff, 0xff } which can be executed as x86
machine code without negative effects. So if an MBR gets
combined with this feature, then its first 8 bytes should
contain no essential commands. <br>
The next blocks of 2 KiB in the System Area will be occupied
by APM entries. The first one covers the part of the ISO
image before the HFS+ filesystem metadata. The second one
marks the range from HFS+ metadata to the end of file
content data. If more ISO image data follow, then a third
partition entry gets produced. Other features of xorriso
might cause the need for more APM entries. <br>
Be aware that HFS+ is case-insensitive although it can
record file names with upper-case and lower-case
letters. Therefore, file names from the iso_rr name tree may
collide in the HFS+ name tree. In this case they get changed
by adding underscore characters and counting numbers. In
case of very long names, it might be necessary to map them
to &quot;MANGLED_...&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&nbsp;<BR><b>El Torito Bootable ISO images:</b><BR></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
precondition for a bootable ISO image is to have in the ISO
image the files of a boot loader. The boot facilities of
computers get directed to such files, which usually execute
further program files from the ISO image. <b>xorrisofs</b>
can produce several kinds of boot block or boot record,
which become part of the ISO image, and get interpreted by
the according boot facility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An <b>El Torito</b> boot record points the bootstrapping facility to
a boot catalog with one or more boot images, which are
binary program files stored in the ISO image. The content of
the boot image files is not in the scope of El Torito. <br>
xorriso composes the boot catalog according to the boot
image files given and structured by options -b,
-e, -el-torito-alt-boot, and
--efi-boot. Often it contains only one
entry. <br>
Normally the boot images are data files inside the ISO
filesystem. By special path
&quot;--interval:appended_partition_NNN:all::&quot;
it is possible to refer to an appended partition. The number
NNN gives the partition number as used with the
corresponding option -append_partition. E.g.: <br>
-append_partition 2 0xef /tmp/efi.img <br>
-e --interval:appended_partition_2:all::
<br>
El Torito gets interpreted by boot facilities PC-BIOS
and EFI. Most bootable GNU/Linux CDs are equipped with
ISOLINUX or GRUB boot images for PC-BIOS. <b><br> xorrisofs</b> supports the example options out of the
ISOLINUX wiki, the options used in GRUB script

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-no-emul-boot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mark the boot image in the
current catalog entry as not emulating floppy or hard disk.
(This is to be used with all known boot loaders.) <br>
If neither -hard-disk-boot nor

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define the ID string of the
boot catalog section where the boot image will be listed. If
the value consists of 56 characters
[0-9A-Fa-f] then it is converted into 28
bytes, else the first 28 characters become the ID string.
The ID string of the first boot image becomes the overall
catalog ID. It is limited to 24 characters. Other id_strings
become section IDs.</p>

xorriso in the course of image production: Block address of
the Primary Volume Descriptor, block address of the boot
image file, size of the boot image file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--grub2-boot-info</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Overwrite bytes 2548 to 2555 in

The address is written as 64 bit little-endian number.
It is the 2KB block address of the boot image content,
multiplied by 4, and then incremented by 5.</p>

it may later be read by other programs in order to learn
about the available boot images.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-eltorito-catalog</b>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&nbsp;<BR><b>System Area, MBR, GPT, APM, other boot blocks:</b><BR></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first 16
blocks of an ISO image are the System Area. It is reserved
for system dependent boot software. This may be the boot
facilities and partition tables of various hardware
architectures. <br>
A <b>MBR</b> (Master Boot Record) contains boot code and a
partition table. It is read by PC-BIOS when booting
from USB stick or hard disk, and by PowerPC CHRP or PReP
when booting. An MBR partiton with type 0xee indicates the
presence of GPT. <br>
A <b>GPT</b> (GUID Partition Table) marks partitions in a
more modern way. It is read by EFI when booting from USB
stick or hard disk, and may be used for finding and mounting
a HFS+ partition inside the ISO image. <br>
An <b>APM</b> (Apple Partition Map) marks the HFS+
partition. It is read by Macs for booting and for mounting.
<br>
MBR, GPT and APM are combinable. APM occupies the first 8
bytes of MBR boot code. All three do not hamper El Torito
booting from CDROM. <b><br> xorrisofs</b> supports further boot facilities: MIPS Big
Endian (SGI), MIPS Little Endian (DEC), SUN SPARC,
HP-PA, DEC Alpha. Those are mutually not combinable
and also not combinable with MBR, GPT, or APM.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several of the
following options expect disk paths as input but also accept
description strings for the libisofs interval reader, which
is able to cut out data from disk files or -indev and
to zeroize parts of the content: -G,
-generic-boot,
--embedded-boot,
--grub2-mbr, -isohybrid-mbr,
-efi-boot-part,
-prep-boot-part, -B,
-sparc-boot, -append_partition. <br>
The description string consists of the following components,
separated by colon &rsquo;:&rsquo; <br>

&quot;--interval:&quot;Flags&quot;:&quot;Interval&quot;:&quot;Zeroizers&quot;:&quot;Source
<br>
The component &quot;--interval&quot; states that
this is not a plain disk path but rather a interval reader
description string. <br>
The component Flags modifies the further interpretation:
<br>
&quot;local_fs&quot; demands to read from a file depicted by
the path in Source. <br>
&quot;imported_iso&quot; demands to read from the
-indev. This works only if -outdev is not the
same as -indev. The Source component is ignored. <br>
&quot;appended_partition_NNN&quot; with a decimal number NNN
works only for options which announce El Torito boot image
paths: -b, -e, --efi-boot. The
number gives the partition number as used with the
corresponding option -append_partition. <br>
The component Interval consists of two byte address numbers
separated by a &quot;-&quot; character. E.g.
&quot;0-429&quot; means to read bytes 0 to 429. <br>
The component Zeroizers consists of zero or more comma
separated strings. They define which part of the read data
to zeroize. Byte number 0 means the byte read from the
Interval start address. Each string may be one of: <br>
&quot;zero_mbrpt&quot; demands to zeroize the MBR partition
table if bytes 510 and 511 bear the MBR signature 0x55 0xaa.
<br>
&quot;zero_gpt&quot; demands to check for a GPT header in
bytes 512 to 1023, to zeroize it and its partition table
blocks. <br>
&quot;zero_apm&quot; demands to check for an APM block 0 and
to zeroize its partition table blocks. <br>
Start_byte&quot;-&quot;End_byte demands to zeroize the
read-in bytes beginning with number Start_byte and
ending after End_byte. <br>
The component Source is the file path with flag
&quot;local_fs&quot;, and ignored with flag
&quot;imported_iso&quot;. <br>
Byte numbers may be scaled by a suffix out of {k,m,g,t,s,d}
meaning multiplication by {1024, 1024k, 1024m, 1024g, 2048,
512}. A scaled value end number depicts the last byte of the
scaled range. <br>
E.g. &quot;0d-0d&quot; is &quot;0-511&quot;.
<br>
Examples: <br>

&quot;local_fs:0-32767:zero_mbrpt,zero_gpt,440-443:/tmp/template.iso&quot;
<br>
&quot;imported_iso:45056d-47103d::&quot; <BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>-G</b> disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Copy at most 32768 bytes from
the given disk file to the very start of the ISO image. <br>
Other than a El Torito boot image, the file disk_path needs
not to be added to the ISO image. It will not show up as
file in the directory trees. <br>
In multi-session situations, the special disk_path
&quot;.&quot; prevents reading of a disk file but
nevertheless causes the adjustments in the existing MBR,
which were ordered by other options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-generic-boot</b>
disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alias of -G.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--embedded-boot</b>
disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alias of -G.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--grub2-mbr</b>
disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Install disk_path in the System
Area and treat it as modern GRUB2 MBR. The content start
address of the first boot image is converted to a count of
512 byte blocks, and an offset of 4 is added. The result is
written as 64 bit little-endian number to byte address
0x1b0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-isohybrid-mbr</b>
disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Install disk_path as ISOLINUX
isohybrid MBR which makes the boot image given by option
-b bootable from USB sticks and hard disks via
PC-BIOS. This preparation is normally done by ISOLINUX
program isohybrid on the already produced ISO image. <br>
The disk path should lead to one of the Syslinux files
isohdp[fp]x*.bin . The MBR gets patched according to
isohybrid needs. The first partition describes the range of
the ISO image. Its start is at block 0 by default, but may
be set to 64 disk blocks by option -partition_offset
16. <br>
For the meaning of special disk_path &quot;.&quot; see
option -G.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-isohybrid-gpt-basdat</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mark the current El Torito boot
image (see options -b and -e) in GPT as
partition of type Basic Data. This works only with
-isohybrid-mbr and has the same impact on the
system area as -efi-boot-part. It cannot
be combined with -efi-boot-part or
-hfsplus. <br>
The first three boot images which are marked by GPT will
also show up as partition entries of type 0xef in MBR. The
MBR partition for PC-BIOS gets type 0x00 rather than
0x17 in this case. Often the further MBR entries are the
ones which actually get used by EFI.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-isohybrid-gpt-hfsplus</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mark the current El Torito boot
image (see options -b and -e) in GPT as
partition of type HFS+. Impact and restrictions are like
with -isohybrid-gpt-basdat.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-isohybrid-apm-hfsplus</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mark the current El Torito boot
image (see options -b and -e) in Apple Partition
Map as partition of type HFS+. This works only with
-isohybrid-mbr and has a similar impact on the
system area as -hfsplus. It cannot be combined with
-efi-boot-part or -hfsplus. <br>
The ISOLINUX isohybrid MBR file must begin by a known
pattern of 32 bytes of x86 machine code which essentially
does nothing. It will get overwritten by 32 bytes of APM
header mock-up.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-part_like_isohybrid</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Control whether
-isohybrid-gpt-basdat,
-isohybrid-gpt-hfsplus, and
-isohybrid-apm-hfsplus apply even if not
-isohybrid-mbr is present. No MBR partition of
type 0xee emerges, even if GPT gets produced. Gaps between
GPT and APM partitions will not be filled by more
partitions. Appended partitions get mentioned in APM if
other APM partitions emerge.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--protective-msdos-label</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Patch the System Area by a
simple PC-DOS partition table where partition 1 claims
the range of the ISO image but leaves the first block
unclaimed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--mbr-force-bootable</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enforce an MBR partition with
&quot;bootable/active&quot; flag if options like
--protective-msdos-label or
--grub2-mbr are given. These options
normally cause the flag to be set if there is an MBR
partition of type other than 0xee or 0xef. If no such
partition exists, then no bootflag is set, unless
--mbr-force-bootable forces creation
of a dummy partition of type 0x00 which covers only the
first block of the ISO image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-partition_offset</b>
2kb_block_adr</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Cause a partition table with a
single partition that begins at the given block address.
This is counted in 2048 byte blocks, not in 512 byte blocks.
If the block address is non-zero then it must be at
least 16. Values larger than 16 are hardly of use. A
non-zero partition offset causes two superblocks to be
generated and two sets of directory trees. The image is then
mountable from its absolute start as well as from the
partition start. <br>
The offset value of an ISO image gets preserved when a new
session is added to a loaded image. So the value defined
here is only in effect if a new ISO image gets written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-partition_hd_cyl</b>
number</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the number of heads per
cylinder for the MBR partition table. 0 chooses a default
value. Maximum is 255.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-partition_sec_hd</b>
number</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the number of sectors per
head for the MBR partition table. 0 chooses a default value.
Maximum is 63. <br>
The product partition_sec_hd * partition_hd_cyl * 512 is the
cylinder size. It should be divisible by 2048 in order to
make exact alignment possible. With appended partitions and
-appended_part_as_gpt there is no limit for the number
of cylinders. Else there may be at most 1024 of them. If the
cylinder size is too small to stay below the limit, then
appropriate values of partition_hd_cyl are chosen with
partition_sec_hd 32 or 63. If the image is larger than
8,422,686,720 bytes, then the cylinder size constraints
cannot be fulfilled for MBR. They seem not overly important
anyway. Flat block addresses in partition tables are good
for 1 TiB.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-partition_cyl_align</b>
mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Control image size alignment to
an integer number of cylinders. It is prescribed by
isohybrid specs and it seems to please program fdisk.
Cylinder size must be divisible by 2048. Images larger than
8,323,596,288 bytes cannot be aligned in MBR partition
table. <br>
Mode &quot;auto&quot; is default. Alignment by padding
happens only if option -isohybrid-mbr is given.
<br>
Mode &quot;on&quot; causes alignment by padding with option
--protective-msdos-label too. Mode
&quot;all&quot; is like &quot;on&quot; but also pads up
partitions from -append_partition to an aligned size.
<br>
Mode &quot;off&quot; disables alignment unconditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-append_partition</b>
partition_number type_code disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Cause a prepared filesystem
image to be appended to the ISO image and to be described by
a partition table entry in a boot block at the start of the
emerging ISO image. The partition entry will bear the size
of the submitted file rounded up to the next multiple of
2048 bytes or to the next multiple of the cylinder size.
<br>
Beware of subsequent multi-session runs. The appended
partition will get overwritten. <br>
partition_number may be 1 to 4. Number 1 will put the whole
ISO image into the unclaimed space before partition 1. So
together with most xorriso MBR or GPT features, number 2
would be the most natural choice. <br>
The type_code may be &quot;FAT12&quot;, &quot;FAT16&quot;,
&quot;Linux&quot;, or a hexadecimal number between 0x00 and
0xff. Not all those numbers will yield usable results. For a
list of codes search the Internet for &quot;Partition
Types&quot; or run fdisk command &quot;L&quot;. This code
matters only with MBR, not with GPT. <br>
If some other command causes the production of GPT, then the
appended partitions will be mentioned there too, even if not
-appended_part_as_gpt is given.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-appended_part_as_gpt</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Marks partitions from
-append_partition in GPT rather than in MBR. In this
case the MBR shows a single partition of type 0xee which
covers the whole output data. <br>
By default, appended partitions get marked in GPT only if
GPT is produced because of other options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-appended_part_as_apm</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Marks partitions from
-append_partition in Apple Partition Map, too. <br>
By default, appended partitions get marked in APM only if
APM is produced because of other options and
-part_like_isohybrid is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-efi-boot-part</b>
disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Copy a file from disk into the
emerging ISO image and mark it by a GPT entry as EFI System
Partition. EFI boot firmware is supposed to use a FAT
filesystem image in such a partition for booting from USB
stick or hard disk. <br>
Instead of a disk_path, the word
--efi-boot-image may be given. It
exposes in GPT the content of the first El Torito EFI boot
image as EFI system partition. EFI boot images are
introduced by options -e or
--efi-boot. The affected EFI boot image
cannot show up in HFS+ because it is stored outside the HFS+
partition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--gpt_disk_guid</b>
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Control whether an emerging GPT
shall get a randomly generated disk GUID or whether the GUID
is supplied by the user. Value &quot;random&quot; is
default. Value &quot;modification-date&quot; produces
a low quality GUID from the value set by option
--modification-date=. <br>
A string of 32 hex digits, or a RFC 4122 compliant GUID
string may be used to set the disk GUID directly. UEFI
prescribes the first three components of a RFC 4122 GUID
string to be byte-swapped in the binary
representation: <br>
E.g. --gpt_disk_guid
2303cd2a-73c7-424a-a298-25632da7f446
equals --gpt_disk_guid
2acd0323c7734a42a29825632da7f446 <br>
The partition GUIDs get generated by minimally varying the
disk GUID.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-chrp-boot-part</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mark the block range of the
whole emerging ISO image as MBR partition of type 0x96. This
is not compatible with any other feature that produces MBR
partition entries. It makes GPT unrecognizable. <br>
CHRP is often used in conjunction with HFS. It is not yet
tested whether HFS+ filesystems produced with option
-hfsplus would boot on any CHRP capable machine which
does not boot pure ISO 9660 as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-chrp-boot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alias of
-chrp-boot-part.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-prep-boot-part</b>
disk_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Copy a file from disk into the
emerging ISO image and mark it by a MBR partition entry of
type 0x41. PReP boot firmware is supposed to read the
content of the partition as single ELF executable file. This
option is compatible with other MBR partitions and with
GPT.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-mips-boot</b>
iso_rr_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Declare a data file in the
image to be a MIPS Big Endian boot file and cause production
of a MIPS Big Endian Volume Header. This is mutually
exclusive with production of other boot blocks like MBR. It
will overwrite the first 512 bytes of any data provided by
-G. Up to 15 boot files can be declared by multiple
-mips-boot options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-mipsel-boot</b>
iso_rr_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Declare a data file in the
image to be the MIPS Little Endian boot file. This is
mutually exclusive with other boot blocks. It will overwrite
the first 512 bytes of any data provided by -G. Only a
single boot file can be declared by
-mipsel-boot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-B</b>
disk_path[,disk_path ...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Cause one or more data files on
disk to be written after the end of the ISO image. A SUN
Disk Label will be written into the first 512 bytes of the
ISO image which lists this image as partition 1 and the
given disk_paths as partition 2 up to 8. <br>
The disk files should contain suitable boot images for SUN
SPARC systems. <br>
The pseudo disk_path &quot;...&quot; causes that all empty
partition entries become copies of the last non-empty
entry. If no other disk_path is given before &quot;...&quot;
then all partitions describe the ISO image. In this case,
the boot loader code has to be imported by option
-G.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-sparc-boot</b>
disk_path[,disk_path ...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alias of -B.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-sparc-label</b>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the ASCII label text of a
SUN Disk Label.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--grub2-sparc-core</b>
iso_rr_path</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Cause the content address and
size of the given data file in the image to be written after
the SUN Disk Label. Both numbers are counted in bytes. The
address is written as 64 bit big-endian number to byte
0x228. The size is written as 32 bit big-endian number
to byte 0x230.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-hppa-cmdline</b>
text</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the PALO command line for
HP-PA. Up to 1023 characters are permitted by default.
With -hppa-hdrversion 4 the limit is 127. <br>
Note that the first five -hppa options are mandatory,
if any of the -hppa options is given. Only option
-hppa-hdrversion is allowed to be missing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-hppa-bootloader</b>

is mutually exclusive with production of other boot blocks
like MBR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&nbsp;<BR><b>Character sets:</b><BR></p>

DVD ISO images are published on the web in jigdo format to
allow end users to download them more efficiently.&quot;
<br>
If the use of libjte was enabled at compile time of xorriso,
then <b>xorrisofs</b> can produce a .jigdo and a .template

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The .jigdo file

Input for this process are the normal arguments for a

disk_path_pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">adds a regular expression
pattern which will get compared with the absolute disk_path
of any data file that was not found in the .md5 list. A

the program run but finally causes a non-zero exit
value of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-jigdo-exclude</b>
disk_path_pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add a regular expression

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-jigdo-map</b>
To=From</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add a string pair of the form
To=From to the parameter list. If a data file gets listed in
the .jigdo file, then it is referred by the file address
from its line in the .md5 file. This file address gets
checked whether it begins with the From string. If so, then
this string will be replaced by the To string and a
&rsquo;:&rsquo; character, before it goes into the .jigdo
file. The From string should end by a &rsquo;/&rsquo;
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-md5-list</b>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Overview of examples:</b> <br>
A simple image production run <br>
Set ISO image paths by -graft-points <br>
Perform multi-session runs <br>
Let xorrisofs work underneath growisofs <br>
Incremental backup of a few directory trees <br>
Incremental backup with accumulated trees <br>
Create bootable images for PC-BIOS and EFI</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>A simple image production run</b> <br>
A prepared file tree in directory ./for_iso gets copied into
the root directory of the ISO image. File permissions get
set to read-only for everybody. Joliet attributes for
Microsoft systems get added. The resulting image gets
written as data file ./image.iso on disk. <br>
$ xorrisofs -r -J -o ./image.iso
./for_iso</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Set ISO image paths by -graft-points</b> <br>
Without option -graft-points each given disk
file is copied into the root directory of the ISO image,
maintaining its name. If a directory is given, then its
files and sub-directories are copied into the root
directory, maintaining their names. <br>
$ xorrisofs ... /home/me/datafile /tmp/directory <br>
yields in the ISO image root directory: <br>
/datafile <br>
/file_1_from_directory <br>
... <br>
/file_N_from_directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With option
-graft-points it is possible to put files and
directories to arbitrary paths in the ISO image. <br>
$ xorrisofs ... -graft-points /home/me/datafile
/dir=/tmp/directory <br>
yields in the ISO image root directory: <br>
/datafile <br>
/dir <br>
Eventually needed parent directories in the image will be
created automatically: <br>
/datafiles/file1=/home/me/datafile <br>
yields in the ISO image: <br>
/datafiles/file1 <br>
The attributes of directory /datafiles get copied from
/home/me on disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally one
should avoid = and \ characters in the ISO part of a
pathspec. But if it must be, one may escape them: <br>
/with_\=_and_\\/file=/tmp/directory/file <br>
yields in the ISO image: <br>
/with_=_and_\/file</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perform multi-session runs</b> <br>
This example works for multi-session media only:
CD-R[W], DVD-R[W], DVD+R, BD-R. Add
cdrskin option --grow_overwriteable_iso to all
-as cdrecord runs in order to enable
multi-session emulation on overwriteable media. <br>
The first session is written like this: <br>
$ xorrisofs -graft-points \ <br>
/tree1=prepared_for_iso/tree1 \ <br>
| xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0
blank=fast -multi -eject - <br>
Follow-up sessions are written like this: <br>
$ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <br>
$ m=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -msinfo)
<br>
$ xorrisofs -M /dev/sr0 -C $m
-graft-points \ <br>
/tree2=prepared_for_iso/tree2 \ <br>
| xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0
-waiti -multi -eject - <br>
Always eject the drive tray between sessions. The old
sessions get read via /dev/sr0. Its device driver might not
be aware of the changed content before it loads the medium
again. In this case the previous session would not be loaded
and the new session would contain only the newly added
files. <br>
For the same reason do not let xorriso -as cdrecord
load the medium, but rather do this manually or by a program
that reads from /dev/sr0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Let xorrisofs work underneath growisofs</b> <br>
growisofs expects an ISO formatter program which understands
options -C and -M. A variable is defined to
override the hardcoded default name. <br>
$ export MKISOFS=&quot;xorrisofs&quot; <br>
$ growisofs -Z /dev/dvd /some/files <br>
$ growisofs -M /dev/dvd /more/files <br>
If no &quot;xorrisofs&quot; is available on your system,
then you will have to create a link pointing to the xorriso
binary and tell growisofs to use it. E.g. by: <br>
$ ln -s $(which xorriso) &quot;$HOME/xorrisofs&quot;
<br>
$ export MKISOFS=&quot;$HOME/xorrisofs&quot; <br>
One may quit mkisofs emulation by argument
&quot;--&quot; and make use of all xorriso
commands. growisofs dislikes options which start with
&quot;-o&quot; but -outdev must be set to
&quot;-&quot;. So use &quot;outdev&quot; instead: <br>
$ growisofs -Z /dev/dvd --for_backup
-- \ <br>
outdev - -update_r /my/files /files <br>
$ growisofs -M /dev/dvd --for_backup
-- \ <br>
outdev - -update_r /my/files /files <br>
Note that --for_backup is given in the mkisofs
emulation. To preserve the recorded extra data it must
already be in effect, when the emulation loads the
image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Incremental backup of a few directory trees</b> <br>
This changes the directory trees /open_source_project and
/personal_mail in the ISO image so that they become exact
copies of their disk counterparts. ISO file objects get
created, deleted or get their attributes adjusted
accordingly. <br>
ACL, xattr, hard links and MD5 checksums will be recorded.
It is expected that inode numbers in the disk filesystem are
persistent over cycles of mounting and booting. Files with
names matching *.o or *.swp get excluded explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To be used
several times on the same medium, whenever an update of the
two disk trees to the medium is desired. Begin with a blank
medium and update it until he run fails gracefully due to
lack of remaining space on the old one. <br>
Do not let xorriso -as cdrecord load the medium, but
rather do this manually or by a program that reads from
/dev/sr0. <br>
$ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <br>
$ msinfo=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0
-msinfo) <br>
$ load_opts= <br>
$ test -n &quot;$msinfo&quot; &amp;&amp;
load_opts=&quot;-M /dev/sr0 -C $msinfo&quot;
<br>
$ xorrisofs $load_opts -o -
--for_backup -m &rsquo;*.o&rsquo; -m
&rsquo;*.swp&rsquo; \ <br>
-V PROJ_MAIL_&quot;$(date
&rsquo;+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S&rsquo;)&quot;
-graft-points \ <br>
-old-root / \ <br>
/projects=/home/thomas/projects \ <br>
/personal_mail=/home/thomas/personal_mail \ <br>
| xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -v
-multi -waiti -eject -</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This makes
sense if the full backup leaves substantial remaining
capacity on media and if the expected changes are much
smaller than the full backup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Better do not use your youngest backup for -old-root</b>.
Have at least two media which you use alternatingly. So only
older backups get endangered by the new write operation,
while the newest backup is stored safely on a different
medium. <br>
Always have a blank medium ready to perform a full backup in
case the update attempt fails due to insufficient remaining
capacity. This failure will not spoil the old medium, of
course.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If inode
numbers on disk are not persistent, then use option
--old-root-no-ino . In this
case an update run will compare recorded MD5 sums against
the current file content on hard disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>mount</b> option <b>-o &quot;sbsector=&quot;</b> on
GNU/Linux or <b>-s</b> on FreeBSD or NetBSD it is
possible to access the session trees which represent the
older backup versions. With CD media, GNU/Linux mount
accepts session numbers directly by its option
&quot;session=&quot;. <br>
Multi-session media and most overwriteable media
written by xorriso can tell the sbsectors of their sessions
by xorriso option -toc: <br>
$ xorriso -dev /dev/sr0 -toc <br>
xorriso can print the matching mount command for a session
number: <br>
$ xorriso -mount_cmd /dev/sr0 session 12 /mnt <br>
or for a volume id that matches a search expression: <br>
$ xorriso -mount_cmd /dev/sr0 volid
&rsquo;*2008_12_05*&rsquo; /mnt <br>
Both yield on standard output something like: <br>
mount -t iso9660 -o
nodev,noexec,nosuid,ro,sbsector=1460256
&rsquo;/dev/sr0&rsquo; &rsquo;/mnt&rsquo; <br>
The superuser may let xorriso execute the mount command
directly: <br>
# osirrox -mount /dev/sr0 &quot;volid&quot;
&rsquo;*2008_12_05*&rsquo; /mnt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Incremental backup with accumulated trees</b> <br>
Solaris does not offer the option to mount older sessions.
In order to keep them accessible, one may map all files to a
file tree under a session directory and accumulate those
directories from session to session. The -root tree is
cloned from the -old-root tree before it gets
compared with the appropriate trees on disk. <br>
This demands to know the previously used session directory
name. <br>
With the first session: <br>
$ xorrisofs -root /session1 \ <br>
-o - --for_backup -m
&rsquo;*.o&rsquo; -m &rsquo;*.swp&rsquo; \ <br>
-V PROJ_MAIL_&quot;$(date
&rsquo;+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S&rsquo;)&quot;
-graft-points \ <br>
/projects=/home/thomas/projects \ <br>
/personal_mail=/home/thomas/personal_mail \ <br>
| xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -v
blank=as_needed \ <br>
-multi -waiti -eject -</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the second
session, option -old-root refers to /session1
and the new -root is /session2. <br>
Do not let xorriso -as cdrecord load the medium, but
rather do this manually or by a program that reads from
/dev/sr0. <br>
$ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <br>
$ msinfo=$(xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0
-msinfo) <br>
$ load_opts= <br>
$ test -n &quot;$msinfo&quot; &amp;&amp;
load_opts=&quot;-M /dev/sr0 -C $msinfo&quot;
<br>
$ xorrisofs $load_opts -root /session2
-old-root /session1 \ <br>
-o - --for_backup -m
&rsquo;*.o&rsquo; -m &rsquo;*.swp&rsquo; \ <br>
-V PROJ_MAIL_&quot;$(date
&rsquo;+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S&rsquo;)&quot;
-graft-points \ <br>
/projects=/home/thomas/projects \ <br>
/personal_mail=/home/thomas/personal_mail \ <br>
| xorriso -as cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -v
-multi -waiti -eject - <br>
With the third session, option -old-root refers
to /session2. The new -root is /session3. And so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Create bootable images for PC-BIOS and EFI</b> <br>
The SYSLINUX/ISOLINUX boot loader suite is popular for
booting PC-BIOS. The ISOLINUX wiki prescribes to
create on disk a directory ./CD_root and to copy all desired
files underneath that directory. Especially file
isolinux.bin shall be copied to
./CD_root/isolinux/isolinux.bin . This is the boot image
file. <br>
The prescribed mkisofs options can be used unchanged with
<b>xorrisofs</b>: <br>
$ xorrisofs -o output.iso \ <br>
-b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat \
<br>
-no-emul-boot
-boot-load-size 4
-boot-info-table \ <br>
./CD_root <br>
Put it on CD by a burn program. E.g.: <br>
$ xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0
blank=as_needed output.iso</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The image from
above example will boot from CD, DVD or BD, but not from USB
stick or other hard-disk-like devices. This can
be done by help of an isohybrid MBR. Syslinux provides
matching template files as isohdp[fp]x*.bin . E.g.
/usr/lib/syslinux/isohdpfx.bin . <br>
If a few hundred KB of size do not matter, then option
-partition_offset can be used to create a partition
table where partition 1 starts not at block 0. This
facilitates later manipulations of the USB stick by tools
for partitioning and formatting. <br>
The image from the following example will be prepared for
booting via MBR and its first partition will start at hard
disk block 64. <br>
It will also boot from optical media. <br>
$ xorrisofs -o output.iso \ <br>
-b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat \
<br>
-no-emul-boot
-boot-load-size 4
-boot-info-table \ <br>
-isohybrid-mbr /usr/lib/syslinux/isohdpfx.bin \
<br>
-partition_offset 16 \ <br>
./CD_root <br>
Become superuser and copy the image to the unpartitioned
base device file of the USB stick. On GNU/Linux this is e.g.
/dev/sdb, not /dev/sdb1. <br>
CAUTION: This will overwrite any partitioning on the USB
stick and make remaining data unaccessible. <br>
So first make sure you got the correct address of the
intended device. E.g. by reading 100 MiB data from it and
watching it blinking: <br>
# dd bs=2K if=/dev/sdb count=50K &gt;/dev/null <br>
Now copy the image onto it <br>
# dd bs=2K if=output.iso of=/dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now for EFI:
<br>
The boot image file has to be the image of an EFI System
Partition, i.e. a FAT filesystem with directory /EFI/BOOT
and boot files with EFI prescribed names: BOOTIA32.EFI for
32 bit x86, BOOTx64.EFI for 64 bit AMD/x86 (in
UEFI-2.4 there is indeed a lower case &quot;x&quot;),
BOOTAA64.EFI for 64 bit ARM. The software in the FAT
filesystem should be able to find and inspect the ISO
filesystem for boot loader configuration and start of
operating system. GRUB2 program grub-mkimage can
produce such a FAT filesystem with suitable content, which
then uses further GRUB2 software from the ISO filesystem.
<br>
EFI boot equipment may be combined with above ISOLINUX
isohybrid for PC-BIOS in a not really UEFI-2.4
compliant way, which obviously works well. It yields MBR and
GPT partition tables, both with nested partitions. Assumed
the EFI System Partition image is ready as
./CD_root/boot/grub/efi.img, add the following options
before the directory address ./CD_root: <br>
-eltorito-alt-boot -e
&rsquo;boot/grub/efi.img&rsquo;
-no-emul-boot \ <br>
-isohybrid-gpt-basdat \ <br>
More compliant with UEFI-2.4 is to decide for either
MBR or GPT and to append a copy of the EFI System Partition
in order to avoid overlap of ISO partition and EFI
partition. Here for MBR: <br>
-eltorito-alt-boot -e
&rsquo;boot/grub/efi.img&rsquo;
-no-emul-boot \ <br>
-append_partition 2 0xef ./CD_root/boot/grub/efi.img \
<br>
The resulting ISOs are supposed to boot from optical media
and USB stick. One may omit option
-eltorito-alt-boot if no option -b
is used to make the ISO bootable via PC-BIOS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For ISOs with
pure GRUB2 boot equipment consider to use GRUB2 tool
grub-mkrescue as frontend to xorrisofs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have a
bootable ISO filesystem and want to know its equipment plus
a proposal how to reproduce it, try: <br>

<h2>FILES
<a name="FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Startup files:</b> <br>
If not --no_rc is given as the first argument
then <b>xorrisofs</b> attempts on startup to read and
execute lines from the following files: <br>
/etc/default/xorriso <br>
/etc/opt/xorriso/rc <br>
/etc/xorriso/xorriso.conf <br>
$HOME/.xorrisorc <br>
The files are read in the sequence given here, but none of
them is required to exist. The lines are not interpreted as
<b>xorrisofs</b> options but as generic xorriso commands.
See man xorriso.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After the
xorriso startup files, the program tries one by one to open
for reading: <br>
./.mkisofsrc <br>
$MKISOFSRC <br>
$HOME/.mkisofsrc <br>
$(dirname $0)/.mkisofsrc <br>
On success it interprets the file content and does not try
further files. The last address is used only if start
argument 0 has a non-trivial dirname. <br>
The reader currently interprets the following NAME=VALUE
pairs: <br>
APPI default for -A <br>
PUBL default for -publisher <br>
SYSI default for -sysid <br>
VOLI default for -V <br>
VOLS default for -volset <br>
Any other lines will be silently ignored.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
environment variables influence the program behavior: <br>
HOME is used to find xorriso and mkisofs startup files. <br>
MKISOFSRC may be used to point the program to a mkisofs
startup file. <br>
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH belongs to the specs of
reproducible-builds.org. It is supposed to be either
undefined or to contain a decimal number which tells the
seconds since january 1st 1970. If it contains a number,
then it is used as time value to set the default of
--modification-date=.
--gpt_disk_guid defaults to
&quot;modification-date&quot;. The default of
--set_all_file_dates is then
&quot;set_to_mtime&quot;. <br>
Startup files and program options can override the effect of
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.</p>
