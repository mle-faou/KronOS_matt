<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>xorrecord</b>
writes preformatted data to CD, DVD, and BD media.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It understands
some options of program cdrecord from cdrtools by Joerg
Schilling. Its implementation is part of program xorriso
which shares no source code with cdrtools, but rather makes
use of libburn for communicating with the drive. <br>
Another, more complete cdrecord emulator is program
<b>cdrskin</b> which uses the same burn functions as
<b>xorrecord</b>, but is able to burn audio CDs and to
handle CD-TEXT.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>MMC, Session, Track, Media types:</b><BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>MMC</b> is a standard out of the SCSI family which defines
the interaction between computers and optical drives. Since
more than a decade all CD, DVD, or BD recorders obey this
standard regardless by what bus cabling they are attached to
the computer. libburn relies on this standard compliance and
on the capability of the operating system to perform SCSI
transactions over the particular bus cabling. <br>
A <b>Session</b> is a data region on an optical disc which
usually gets written in a single sweep. It contains at least
one <b>Track</b> which is a contiguous string of readable
blocks. <b>xorrecord</b> produces a single session with a
single data track which consists of blocks with 2048 bytes
each. It chooses the write mode automatically according to
media type, medium state, and option -multi. <br>
On CD media there are other track types, like audio, and
particular write modes like TAO and SAO. CD and DVD-
media can put more than one track into a session. Some of
these features can be addressed by program <b>cdrskin</b>.
<br>
MMC describes several recordable <b>media types</b> which
roughly form two families. <b><br> Sequentially recordable media</b> are CD-R,
CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-R DL, DVD-RW,
DVD+R, DVD+R DL, BD-R. Except DVD-R DL they can
store more than one session if there is still unwritten
space and if the previous session was written with option
<b>-multi</b>. CD-RW and DVD-RW can be
blanked in order to be re-usable from scratch. <b><br> Overwritable media</b> are DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, formatted
DVD-RW, BD-RE. They offer a single session with
a single track for random access writing. There is no need
to blank overwritable media before re-use. <br>
DVD-RW media are sold in sequentially recordable state
but can be formatted once to become overwritable. See
options <b>blank=format_overwrite</b> and
<b>blank=deformat</b>. <br>
If ISO 9660 filesystems are to be stored on overwritable
media, then it is possible to emulate multiple sessions, by
using option <b>--grow_overwriteable_iso</b>. In
this case, the need for blanking before re-use is
emulated too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Drive preparation and addressing:</b><BR> <br>
The drives, CD, DVD, or BD burners, are accessed via file
addresses which are specific to libburn and the operating
system. Those addresses get listed by a run of <b>xorrecord --devices</b> or <b>xorriso -device_links</b>. <br>
On GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD, the user needs
rw-permission for the device file. On Solaris, the
user needs r-permission and privilege
&quot;sys_devices&quot;, which is usually gained by running
<b>xorrecord</b> via command pfexec. <br>
These permissions or privileges are needed already for
listing a drive. So it might be necessary to get the
overview as superuser or via pfexec. <b><br> xorrecord</b> does not perform cdrecord option
-scanbus and does not accept the addresses of form
Bus,Target,Lun which are told by -scanbus. If support
for these addresses is necessary, consider to use program
cdrskin. <br>
It is possible to let <b>xorrecord</b> work on emulated
drives. Their addresses begin by prefix &quot;stdio:&quot;
followed by a file address. The emulated media behavior
depends on the file type. See man xorriso for details. <br>
If standard output is chosen as emulated drive, then all
program result texts, which usually appear on standard
output, will get redirected to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Relation to program xorriso:</b><BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>xorrecord</b> is actually a command mode of program
<b>xorriso</b>, which gets entered either by xorriso command
&quot;-as cdrecord&quot; or by starting the program by
one of the names &quot;xorrecord&quot;,
&quot;cdrecord&quot;, &quot;wodim&quot;, or
&quot;cdrskin&quot;. <br>
This command mode can be left by argument
&quot;--&quot; which leads to generic xorriso
command mode. See <b>man xorriso</b> for its description.
Other than in xorriso command mode, the sequence of the
cdrecord emulation options does not matter. All pending
actions get performed in a fixed sequence before the program
run ends or before cdrecord emulation ends.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Addressing the drive: </b><BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>--devices</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print the list of accessible
CD, DVD, or BD drives to standard output. Drives might be
inaccessible if the user lacks of permissions to use them or
if the drive is in use by another program. <br>
Each accessible drive is shown by a line like: <br>
0 -dev &rsquo;/dev/sr0&rsquo; rwrw-- :
&rsquo;TSSTcorp&rsquo; &rsquo;CDDVDW SH-S203B&rsquo;
<br>
The libburn address of this drive is &rsquo;/dev/sr0&rsquo;.
&rsquo;TSSTcorp&rsquo; is the name of the vendor (in this
case: Toshiba Samsung Storage Technologies Corporation),
&rsquo;CDDVDW SH-S203B&rsquo; is the model name (in
this case: a DVD burner). <br>
Afterwards end emulation without performing any further
drive operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dev=drive_address</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the libburn address of the
drive to be used. <br>
E.g. on GNU/Linux: dev=/dev/sr0 <br>
E.g. on FreeBSD: dev=/dev/cd0 <br>
E.g. on NetBSD: dev=/dev/rcd0d <br>
E.g. on Solaris: dev=/dev/rdsk/c2t2d0s2 <br>
See also above &quot;Drive preparation and addressing&quot;.
<br>
The medium in the drive should not be mounted or be
otherwise in use. <br>
This option will only get into effect if a track source, a
blank= option, or a drive inquiry option is given. Else it
will lead to a SORRY event and normally cause a
non-zero exit value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&nbsp;<BR><b>Inquiring drive and media:</b><BR>&nbsp;<BR></p>

<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Print to standard output: vendor, model name, and
firmware revision of the drive.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-checkdrive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print unconditionally that the
drive supports burnfree, SAO, and TAO. Also print the output
of option -inq.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>-atip</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Print the output of -checkdrive, the most capable
profile of the medium in the drive, the list of profiles
which are supported by the drive, whether it is erasable
(i.e. can be blanked), the media manufacturer, and the
medium product name.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profiles are usage models,
which are often tied to a particular media type (e.g.
CD-RW), but may also apply to a family of media. E.g.
profile CD-ROM applies to all CD media which contain
data.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-toc</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print a table of content of the
medium in the drive. The output is not compatible to
cdrecord option -toc, but rather the one of
<b>xorriso</b> command -toc. It lists the address,
vendor, model name, and firmware revision of the drive.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">About the medium it tells
product name and manufacturer, whether there is already
content written, and if so, whether the medium is closed or
appendable. Appendable media can take another session. The
amount of readable and writable data is told. If there are
sessions, then their start block address and size is
reported. If a session contains an ISO 9660 filesystem, then
its Volume Id is reported. If the medium is writable, then
the next writable block address is reported. <br>
If not option <b>--grow_overwriteable_iso</b> is
given or no ISO 9660 file system is present on the medium,
then overwritable media are reported as being blank. This is
due to the fact that they can be written from scratch
without further preparation, and that MMC does not
distinguish between data written by the most previous burn
run and older data which have not been overwritten by that
burn run. Consequently, these media are reported with 0
readable blocks, although all their writable blocks normally
are readable, too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-msinfo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print the argument text for
option -C of programs mkisofs, genisoimage, or
xorrisofs. It consists of two numbers separated by a comma.
<br>
The first number tells the first block of the first track of
the last recorded session. This is also the address used by
default when operating systems mount a medium with e.g. ISO
9660 filesystem. <br>
The second number tells the next writable address, where
<b>xorrecord</b> will begin to write the next session. <br>
This option is only valid for written, appendable media. In
all other cases it will yield no output text but will abort
the program with non-zero exit value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&nbsp;<BR><b>Settings for the burn run:</b><BR></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A burn run
requires exactly one track source address argument, which
tells from where to read the data which shall be put into
the upcomming session. The medium state must be either blank
or appendable. <br>
Track source may be &quot;-&quot; for standard input
or the address of a readable file of any type except
directories. Nearly all media types accept a track source
with unpredictable byte count, like standard input or named
pipes. Nevertheless, DVD-R DL and DVD-RW blanked
by mode deformat_quickest demand exact in-advance
reservation of the track size, so that they either need to
be read from a source of predictable length, or need to be
accompanied by option <b>tsize=</b> or by option
<b>-isosize</b>. <br>
Several options expect a size value as argument. A number
with a trailing letter &quot;b&quot; or without a trailing
letter is a plain byte count. Other trailing letters cause
multiplication of the given number by a scaling factor: <br>
&quot;k&quot; or &quot;K&quot; = 1024 , &quot;m&quot; or
&quot;M&quot; = 1024k , &quot;g&quot; or &quot;G&quot; =
1024m , &quot;s&quot; or &quot;S&quot; = 2048 <br>
E.g. tsize=234567s means a size of 234567 * 2048 = 480393216
bytes. <BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>blank=mode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Blank a CD-RW or
DVD-RW to make it re-usable from scratch. Format
a DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, BD-R, or
BD-RE if not yet formatted. <br>
This operation normally makes any recorded data on the
medium unreadable. It is combinable with burning in the same
run of <b>xorrecord</b>, or it may be performed without a
track source, leaving the medium empty. <br>
The mode given with blank= selects the particular behavior:
<br>
as_needed</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Try to make the media ready for
writing from scratch. If it needs formatting, then format
it. If it is not blank, then try to apply blank=fast. It is
a reason to abort if the medium cannot assume thoroughly
writeable state, e.g. if it is a non-blank
write-once. <br>
This leaves unformatted DVD-RW in unformatted blank
state. To format DVD-RW use blank=format_overwrite.
Blank unformatted BD-R stay unformatted. <br>
(Note: blank=as_needed is not an original cdrecord
option.)</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">deformat</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Like blank=all but with the
additional ability to blank overwriteable DVD-RW. This
will destroy their formatting and make them sequentially
recordable. <br>
(Note: blank=deformat is not an original cdrecord
options)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">deformat_quickest</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Like blank=deformat but
blanking DVD-RW only minimally. This is faster than
full blanking but yields media incapable of writing tracks
of unpredicatable size. Multi-session will not be
possible either. <br>
(Note: blank=deformat_quickest is not an original cdrecord
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">format_overwrite</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Format a DVD-RW to
&quot;Restricted Overwrite&quot;. The user should bring some
patience. <br>
Format unformatted DVD+RW, BD-RE or blank BD-R
to their default size. It is not mandatory to do this with
DVD+RW and BD-RE media, because they will get
formatted automatically on the first write attempt. <br>
BD-R media may be written in unformatted state. This
keeps disabled the replacement of bad blocks and enables
full nominal write speed. Once BD-R media are written,
they cannot be formatted any more. <br>
For re-formatting already formatted media or for
formatting with non-default size, use program
<b>xorriso</b> with command <b>-format</b>. <br>
(Note: blank=format_overwrite is not an original cdrecord
options)</p>

<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option keeps CD,
unformatted DVD-R[W], DVD+R, or BD-R appendable
after the current session has been written. Without it the
disc gets closed and may not be written any more -
unless it is a -RW and gets blanked, which causes loss
of its content.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option cannot be applied
to DVD-R DL or to DVD-RW which were blanked by
mode &quot;deformat_quickest&quot;. Option
--multi_if_possible may automatically recognize
and handle this situation. <br>
In order to have all filesystem content accessible, the
eventual ISO-9660 filesystem of a follow-up
session needs to be prepared in a special way by the
filesystem formatter program. mkisofs, genisoimage, and
xorrisofs expect particular info about the situation which
can be retrieved by <b>xorrecord</b> option -msinfo.
<br>
With overwriteable DVD or BD media, -multi cannot mark
the end of the session. So when adding a new session, this
end has to be determined from the payload. Currently only
ISO-9660 filesystems can be used that way. See option
<b>--grow_overwriteable_iso</b>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try to perform the drive
operations without actually affecting the inserted media.
There is no warranty that this will work with a particular
combination of drive and media. Blanking is prevented
reliably, though. To avoid inadverted real burning,
-dummy refuses burn runs on anything but
CD-R[W], DVD-R[W], or emulated

</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">One should use this if
xorrisofs is working at the end of a pipe where the feeder
process reads from the drive before it starts writing its
output into xorrisofs. Example: <br>
xorrisofs ... -C 0,12800 -M /dev/sr0 ... | \
<br>
xorrecord dev=/dev/sr0 ... -waiti - <br>
This option works even if standard input is not the track
source. If no process is piping in, then the Enter key of
your terminal will act as trigger for <b>xorrecord</b>. Note
that this input line will not be consumed by cdrskin if
standard input is not the track source. It will end up as
shell command, usually.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tsize=size</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Announce the exact size of the
track source. This is necessary with DVD-R DL media
and with quickest blanked DVD-RW, if the size cannot
be determined in advance from the track source. E.g. if it
is standard input or a named pipe. <br>
If the track source does not deliver the predicted amount of
bytes, the remainder of the track is padded with zeros. This
is not considered an error. If on the other hand the track
source delivers more than the announced bytes then the track
on media gets truncated to the predicted size and xorrecord
exits with non-zero value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-isosize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Try to obtain the track size
from the content of the track source. This works only if the
track source bears an ISO 9660 filesystem. Any other track
source content will cause the burn run to abort. <br>
If the track source is not a regular file or block device,
then this option will work only if the program&rsquo;s fifo
size is at least 64k. See option fs=.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>padsize=size</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add the given amount of
trailing zeros to the upcomming track. This feature can be
disabled by size 0. Default is 300 kB in order to work
around a problem with GNU/Linux which often fails to read
the last few blocks of a CD track which was written in write
mode TAO. TAO is used by <b>xorrecord</b> if the track size
cannot be predicted or if the CD medium is not blank but
appendable.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>fs=size</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the size of the program
fifo buffer to the given value rather than the default of
4m. <br>
The fifo buffers a temporary surplus of track source data in
order to provide the drive with a steady stream during times
of temporary lack of track source supply. <br>
Other than cdrecord, xorrecord enables drive buffer underrun
protection by default and does not wait with writing until
the fifo is full for a first time. On very old CD drives and
slow computers, this might cause aborted burn runs. In this
case, consider to use program <b>cdrskin</b> for CD burning.
DVD and BD drives tolerate buffer underrun without problems.
<br>
The larger the fifo, the longer periods of poor source
supply can be compensated. But a large fifo can deprive the
operating system of read cache for better filesystem
performance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>speed=value</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the write speed. Default is
0 = maximum speed. Speed can be given in media type
dependent x-speed numbers or as a desired throughput
per second in MMC compliant kB (= 1000) or MB (= 1000 kB).
Media x-speed factor can be set explicitly by
appending &quot;c&quot; for CD, &quot;d&quot; for DVD,
&quot;b&quot; for BD. &quot;x&quot; is optional. <br>
Example speeds: <br>
706k = 706kB/s = 4c = 4xCD <br>
5540k = 5540kB/s = 4d = 4xDVD <br>
If there is no hint about the speed unit attached, then the
medium in the drive will decide. Default unit is CD, 1x =
176,400 raw bytes/second. With DVD, 1x = 1,385,000
bytes/second. With BD, 1x = 4,495,625 bytes/second. <br>
MMC drives usually activate their own idea of speed and take
the speed value given by the burn program only as a hint for
their own decision.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&nbsp;<BR><b>Options not compatible to cdrecord:</b><BR>&nbsp;<BR><b>--no_rc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Only if used as first command
line argument this option prevents reading and
interpretation of startup files. See section FILES
below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>drive_scsi_dev_family=sr|sdc|sg|default</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">GNU/Linux specific: <br>
By default, cdrskin tries to map Linux drive addresses to
/dev/sr* before they get opened for operating the drive.
This coordinates well with other use cases of optical
drives, like mount(8). But since year 2010 all /dev/sr*
share a global lock which allows only one drive to process
an SCSI command while all others have to wait for its
completion. This yields awful throughput if more than one
drive is writing or reading simultaneously. <br>
The global lock is not applied to device files /dev/sg* and
also not with the system calls read(2), write(2). But
ioctl(SG_IO) is affected, which is needed to perform the
SCSI commands for optical burning. <br>
So for simultaneous burn runs on modern GNU/Linux it is
advisable to use drive_scsi_dev_family=&quot;sg&quot;. The
drive addresses may then well be given as /dev/sr* but will
nevertheless get used as /dev/sg*.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--grow_overwriteable_iso</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable emulation of
multi-session writing on overwriteable media which
contain an ISO 9660 filesystem. This emulation is learned
from growisofs -M but adapted to the usage model of
<br>
xorrecord -msinfo <br>
xorrisofs -C -M | xorrecord -waiti
-multi - <br>
for sequential media. <br>
--grow_overwriteable_iso does not hamper the use
of true multi-session media. I.e. it is possible to
use the same <b>xorrecord</b> options with both kinds of
media and to achieve similar results if ISO 9660 filesystem
images are to be written. This option implies option
-isosize and therefore demands that the track source
is a ISO 9660 filesystem image. <br>
With overwriteable media and no option blank=fast|all
present it expands an eventual ISO 9660 filesystem on media.
It is assumed that this image&rsquo;s inner size description
points to the end of the valuable data. Overwriteable media
with a recognizable ISO 9660 size will be regarded as
appendable rather than as blank. I.e. options -msinfo
and -toc will work. -toc will always show a
single session with its size increasing with every added ISO
9660 image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--multi_if_possible</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Apply option -multi if
the medium is suitable. Not suitable are DVD-R DL and
DVD-RW, which were blanked with mode
&quot;deformat_quickest&quot;. <br>
Not all drives correctly recognize such fast-blanked
DVD-RW which need &quot;on&quot;. If there is well
founded suspicion that a burn run failed due to
-multi, then this causes a re-try without
-multi.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>stream_recording=&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|number</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mode &quot;on&quot; requests
that compliance to the desired speed setting is preferred
over management of write errors. With DVD-RAM and BD
this can bring effective write speed near to the nominal
write speed of the media. But it will also disable the
automatic use of replacement blocks if write errors occur.
It might as well be disliked or ignored by the drive. <br>
If a number is given, then error management stays enabled
for all byte addresses below that number. Any number below
16s is the same as &quot;off&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dvd_obs=&quot;default&quot;|&quot;32k&quot;|&quot;64k&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Linux specific: Set the number
of bytes to be transmitted with each write operation to DVD
or BD media. Tracks get padded up to the next multiple of
this write size. A number of 64 KB may improve throughput
with bus systems which show latency problems. The default
depends on media type, option stream_recording=, and on
compile time options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>modesty_on_drive=parameter[:parameters]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Control whether the drive
buffer shall be kept from getting completely filled.
Parameter &quot;on&quot; (or &quot;1&quot;) keeps the
program from trying to write to the burner drive while its
buffer is in danger to be filled over a given limit. If this
filling is exceeded then the program will wait until the
filling reaches a given low percentage value. <br>
This can ease the load on operating system and drive
controller and thus help with achieving better input
bandwidth if disk and burner are not on independent
controllers (like hda and hdb). It may also help with
simultaneous burns on different burners with Linux kernels
like 3.16, if one has reason not to fix the problem by
drive_scsi_dev_family=&quot;sg&quot;. On the other hand it
increases the risk of buffer underflow and thus reduced
write speed. <br>
Some burners are not suitable because they report buffer
fill with granularity too coarse in size or time, or expect
their buffer to be filled to the top before they go to full
speed. <br>
Parameters &quot;off&quot; or &quot;0&quot; disable this
feature. <br>
The threshold for beginning to wait is given by parameter
&quot;max_percent=&quot;. Parameter &quot;min_percent=&quot;
defines the threshold for resuming transmission. Percentages
are permissible in the range of 25 to 100. Numbers in this
range without a prepended name are interpreted as
&quot;on:min_percent=&quot;. <br>
E.g.: modesty_on_drive=75 <br>
The optimal values depend on the buffer behavior of the
drive. <br>
Parameter &quot;timeout_sec=&quot; defines after which time
of unsuccessful waiting the modesty shall be disabled
because it does not work. <br>
Parameter &quot;min_usec=&quot; defines the initial sleeping
period in microseconds. If the drive buffer appears to be
too full for sending more data, the program will wait the
given time and inquire the buffer fill state again. If
repeated inquiry shows not enough free space, the sleep time
will slowly be increased to what parameter
&quot;max_usec=&quot; defines. <br>
Parameters, which are not mentioned with a modesty_on_drive=
option, stay unchanged. Default is: <br>
modesty_on_drive=off:min_percent=90:max_percent=95: <br>
timeout_sec=120:min_usec=5000:max_usec=25000</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>use_immed_bit=&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|&quot;default&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Control whether several long
lasting SCSI commands shall be executed with the Immed bit,
which makes the commands end early while the drive operation
is still going on. xorriso then inquires progress indication
until the drive reports to be ready again. If this feature
is turned off, then blanking and formatting will show no
progress indication. <br>
It may depend on the operating system whether
-use_immed_bit is set to &quot;off&quot; by
default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>write_start_address=value</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the block address on
overwritable media where to start writing the track. With
DVD+RW, DVD-RAM or BD-RE, byte_offset must be
aligned to 2 kiB blocks, but better is 32 kiB on DVD and 64
kiB on BD. With formatted DVD-RW 32 kiB alignment is
mandatory. <br>
Other media are not suitable for this option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>stdio_sync=&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|number</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the number of bytes after
which to force output to emulated stdio: drives. This
forcing keeps the memory from being clogged with lots of
pending data for slow devices. Default &quot;on&quot; is the
same as &quot;16m&quot;. Forced output can be disabled by
&quot;off&quot;.</p>

This command may also be used to format BD-R media
before first use, in order to enable handling of write
errors. Several hundred MB of spare blocks will be reserved
and write runs on such media will perform with less than
half nominal speed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>De-format DVD-RW to make it capable of multi-session again:</b> <br>
$ xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=deformat</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Write a single ISO 9660 filesystem image:</b> <br>
$ xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 speed=12 fs=8m \ <br>
blank=as_needed -eject padsize=300k my_image.iso</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Write multiple ISO 9660 sessions:</b> <br>
This is possible with all media except minimally blanked
DVD-RW and DVD-R DL, which cannot do
multi-session. <br>
The first session is written like in the previous example,
except that option -multi is used. It will contain the
files of hard disk directory ./tree1 under the ISO 9660
directory /dir1: <br>
$ xorrisofs -o image_1.iso -J
-graft-points /dir1=./tree1 <br>
$ xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 speed=12 fs=8m \ <br>
-multi --grow_overwriteable_iso \ <br>
blank=as_needed -eject padsize=300k image_1.iso <br>
For the second session xorrisofs needs to know the
-msinfo numbers of the medium. Further it will read
data from the medium by using the system&rsquo;s
read-only CD-ROM driver. <br>
It is advised to load the tray manually or via dd by the
CD-ROM driver, rather than letting xorrecord do this
by its own SCSI driver. Many system CD-ROM drivers do
not take notice of xorrecord&rsquo;s activities. <br>
$ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <br>
Now get the -msinfo numbers: <br>
$ m=$(xorrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -msinfo) <br>
and use them with xorrisofs to add ./tree2 to the image as
/dir2: <br>
$ xorrisofs -M /dev/sr0 -C $m -o
image_2.iso \ <br>
-J -graft-points /dir2=./tree2 <br>
Now burn the new session onto the same medium. This time
without blanking: <br>
$ xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 speed=12 fs=8m \ <br>
-multi --grow_overwriteable_iso \ <br>
-eject padsize=300k image_2.iso <br>
Operating systems which mount this medium will read the
superblock of the second session and show both directories
/dir1 and /dir2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Write ISO 9660 session on-the-fly:</b> <br>
It is possible to combine the run of <b>xorrisofs</b> and
<b>xorrecord</b> in a pipeline without storing the ISO 9660
image as file on hard disk: <br>
$ xorrisofs -M /dev/sr0 -C $m \ <br>
-J -graft-points /dir2=./tree2 \ <br>
| xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 speed=12 fs=8m \ <br>
-waiti -multi
--grow_overwriteable_iso \ <br>
-eject padsize=300k - <br>
This is also the main use case of program <b>xorriso</b>
itself, where this run would look like: <br>
$ xorriso -dev /dev/sr0 -joliet on -speed
12 -fs 8m \ <br>
-map ./tree2 /dir2 -commit_eject all</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Write compressed afio archive on-the-fly:</b> <br>
This is possible with all media except minimally blanked
DVD-RW and DVD-R DL. Since the compressed output
stream is of very variable speed, a larger fifo is advised.
Nevertheless, this example is not suitable for very old CD
drives which have no underrun protection and thus would
abort the burn run on temporary data shortage. <br>
$ find . | afio -oZ - | \ <br>
xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 speed=12 fs=64m \ <br>
-multi padsize=300k - <br>
afio archives do not contain references to absolute data
block addresses. So they need no special precautions for
multi-session. One may get the session start addresses
by option -toc, and then use dd option skip= to begin
reading at one of those addresses. E.g. for listing its
content: <br>
$ dd if=/dev/sr0 bs=2048 skip=64046 | afio -tvZ
- <br>
afio will know when the end of the archive is reached.</p>
